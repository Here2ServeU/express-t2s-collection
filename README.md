# Express T2S App Monorepo

## Overview

Welcome to the Express T2S App Monorepo, a structured collection of Node.js + Express applications designed to power the mission of **Transformed 2 Succeed (T2S)**.

Each versioned folder (v1, v2, v3, etc.) reflects a milestone in building a secure, scalable, and production-ready web platform using DevOps and Cloud best practices.

Our long-term goal is to deliver a mentorship and learning system that is:
- Dockerized for consistency across environments
- Cloud-deployed via Terraform (ECR, ECS, EKS on AWS)
- Secured with IAM, WAF, and DevSecOps scanning
- Observable with tools like Prometheus and Grafana
- Cost-aware through FinOps integration
- Automated with CI/CD, GitOps, and AI-enhanced monitoring

---

## Project Goals

This monorepo will help you:
- Build Docker images for each app version
- Push to Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry)
- Deploy using ECS and EKS with Terraform
- Automate CI/CD using GitHub Actions
- Integrate observability (Prometheus, Grafana, CloudWatch)
- Secure infrastructure using Trivy, Checkov, IAM, and WAF
- Optimize infrastructure costs using FinOps tools
- Add Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) best practices
- Incorporate AI for automated health checks and alerts

Each versioned subproject includes its own `guide.md` file with detailed instructions for:
- Building and testing the app
- Infrastructure deployment using Terraform
- CI/CD automation using GitHub Actions
- Kubernetes configuration (if applicable)
- Security and cost optimization

To begin working with a specific version:

```bash
# Navigate to the desired version folder
cd express-t2s-app/express-t2s-app-v3

# Open the detailed guide
code guide.md  # Or use any markdown viewer/editor
```

üõ†Ô∏è Each version builds upon the previous one ‚Äî feel free to explore them in order or jump to the one you need.
