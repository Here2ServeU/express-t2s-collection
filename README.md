# Express T2S App Monorepo

## Overview (Situation)

This repository serves as the **monorepo** for the evolving Express-based web applications that power the mission of **Transformed 2 Succeed (T2S)**. Each version (`v1`, `v2`, etc.) represents a progressive iteration of the Node.js + Express app as we move from MVP to a production-grade, cloud-native, DevOps-enabled platform.

Our long-term vision is to create a **mentorship system** that is:
- Containerized using Docker
- Deployable to AWS (ECR, ECS, EKS)
- Monitored and observable
- Secured with IAM and DevSecOps practices
- Scalable, cost-efficient, and reliable

---

## Goals (Task)

- Containerize each app version with Docker
- Push container images to **AWS ECR**
- Deploy via **ECS Fargate**, then migrate to **EKS**
- Implement **CI/CD** using GitHub Actions
- Add **observability** and monitoring (Grafana, Prometheus, X-Ray)
- Enable **DevSecOps** scanning (Trivy, Checkov)
- Support **authentication, email notifications**, and mentorship automation

---

## Features Implemented (Action)

Each version directory (e.g. `express-t2s-app-v1`) includes:

- `Node.js + Express` backend server
- Public static asset folder and HTML signup form
- Git integration with branching and version tracking
- CI/CD-ready project structure with Docker support

#### Run Locally

```bash
cd express-t2s-app-v1  # or any version
npm install
node index.js
```

## Action Plan (Whatâ€™s Next)

### Phase 1: Containerization & CI/CD
- [ ] Create Dockerfile & .dockerignore for each version
- [ ] Push images to ECR
- [ ] Build GitHub Actions workflows

### Phase 2: AWS ECS Deployment
- [ ] Set up ECS with Fargate + Load Balancer
- [ ] Enable HTTPS + Route 53 domain

### Phase 3: EKS + GitOps
- [ ] Create EKS with Terraform
- [ ] Use Helm + ArgoCD for Kubernetes deployments

### Phase 4: DevSecOps & IAM
- [ ] Trivy + Checkov integration
- [ ] Use AWS WAF, IAM, and Secrets Manager

### Phase 5: Observability
- [ ] Prometheus & Grafana Dashboards
- [ ] CloudWatch Logs and AWS X-Ray

### Phase 6: Mentorship Automation
- [ ] Log mentee form data
- [ ] Send emails on signup
- [ ] Store submissions securely
