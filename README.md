# Express Web App Series  

This project is a **teaching series** that takes you step by step through the journey of building, containerizing, and deploying a real-world Express.js application using modern DevOps and Cloud practices.  

The goal is to help beginners grow into confident engineers who can **design, deploy, and manage production-ready applications on AWS using Terraform and Kubernetes**.  

---

## Why This Series?  

Companies like **Netflix, Facebook, and Comcast** run highly available, secure, and scalable applications in the cloud. The same principles they use‚Äî**Infrastructure as Code, containers, Kubernetes, and automation**‚Äîare accessible to you.  

This series shows you how to:  
- Start with a simple Express.js app  
- Containerize it with Docker  
- Store and manage images in AWS ECR  
- Deploy and scale using Amazon EKS  
- Manage infrastructure with Terraform  
- Expose your app securely with Ingress and Load Balancers  

---

## What You‚Äôll Learn  

- **Part 1:** Building the base Express.js app  
- **Part 2:** Dockerizing the app  
- **Part 3:** Writing Kubernetes manifests  
- **Part 4:** Creating AWS infrastructure with Terraform (EKS, VPC, IAM, ECR)  
- **Part 5** Deploying to EKS, scaling with HPA,and Helm package management  
- **Part 6** Monitoring, Observability
- **Part 7** DevSecOps
- **Part 8** FinOps
- **Part 9** Integrating AI into the Infrastructure

## Tools You‚Äôll Use  

- **Node.js / Express.js** ‚Äì The web app  
- **Docker** ‚Äì Containerization  
- **Terraform** ‚Äì Infrastructure as Code  
- **Amazon EKS** ‚Äì Managed Kubernetes  
- **Amazon ECR** ‚Äì Private container registry

## Who Is This For?  

- Students and beginners learning Cloud & DevOps  
- Developers who want to move their apps to the cloud  
- Anyone preparing for **real-world DevOps/SRE roles**  

No prior Kubernetes or Terraform knowledge is required‚Äîeverything is explained step by step.  

---

## Next Steps  

As you follow this series, you‚Äôll gain the skills to **go from running an app locally to deploying it in the cloud at production scale**.  

Stay tuned for upcoming parts where we‚Äôll connect all the pieces, expose the app over the internet, and add automation with GitHub Actions.
